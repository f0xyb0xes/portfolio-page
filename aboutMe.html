            <p>Why, hello there! I didn't see you come in. I'm Julia, and after years in the food service business, I'm eager to start my new career in coding. Take a look around, and I bet you'll like what you see.</p>

                <h3>Fake D&D Fan Club Page</h3>
                <img src="resources/images/clubPageScreenshot.png" />
                <p>When prompted to make a homepage for a club of my own choosing, I decided to make up a D&D fan club. It should come as no surprise that the coder is a nerd, right? I incorporated the use of CSS to make the page responsive for different screen sizes.</p>

                <h3>Web Design Template Assignment</h3>
                <img src="resources/images/stylePageScreenshot.png" />
                <p>This assignment to make a web design template was included to provide some insight into aesthetic choices I might make on my own. I also just had enjoyed this project because flexing those creative muscles is always a good exercise. I can't wait to use that creativity to help you make your dream webpage.</p>

                <h3>Fruity Pebbles Cream Puffs</h3>
                <img src="resources/images/IMG_0525.JPG" />
                <p>Not a coding project, just a delicious original creation from my kitchen. The base for the pastry cream is Fruity Pebbles infused milk, taking breakfast cereal to a classier level.</p>
