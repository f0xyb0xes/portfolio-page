# portfolio-page
Welcome to my portfolio page. Hopefully all the code and links work as expected!

## features
It's a home page about me! and also a contact page with my email address. I'll update it later once I get some social media stuff in order.

## how to use
Use it like any other site. There are a couple fun surprises if you look hard enough!

## technologies
This site uses HTML and CSS, along with a little inline JavaScript.

##liscense
Please don't steal this or edit it all willy-nilly! This is mostly a school project but kind of serious stuff.
